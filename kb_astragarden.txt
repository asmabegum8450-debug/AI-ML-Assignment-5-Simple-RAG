AstraGarden is a small experimental orbital biodome that orbits 500 kilometers above Earth. 
The biodome was launched in 2037 as part of an international collaboration to test long-term 
food production in microgravity. AstraGarden contains three main habitat rings: the Crop Ring, 
the Research Ring, and the Habitat Ring. The Crop Ring uses rotating sections to simulate 
partial gravity for soil-based crops like potatoes, dwarf wheat, and leafy greens.

The Research Ring is dedicated to studying plant biology, closed-loop life support systems, 
and microbial ecosystems. Scientists on AstraGarden run experiments on how root systems 
develop in low gravity, and how different lighting schedules affect plant growth and nutrient content. 
Waste from the crew and unused plant matter is recycled through bio-reactors that convert organic matter 
into fertilizer and usable water, making the station mostly self-sustaining.

The Habitat Ring supports up to twelve crew members at a time and includes living quarters, 
a small medical bay, exercise facilities, and a panoramic observation deck. Crew members rotate in 
six-month missions, with a strong focus on mental health and social routines to reduce isolation. 
AstraGarden's mission is to demonstrate that a small, modular biodome can provide reliable food, 
clean air, and water for future deep space missions to Mars and beyond.
